					<p>"How do you do Nothing," asked Pooh after he had wondered for a long time.</p>

					<p>"Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it,'What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?'<br/> and you say, 'Oh, Nothing,' and then you go and do it.</p>

					<p>It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."</p>
